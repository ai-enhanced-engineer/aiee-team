## Production Readiness Scoring

### Scoring Framework (0-100)

| Component | Weight | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Authentication** | 20% | Secure credential handling, no hardcoded secrets |
| **Authorization** | 20% | Proper access controls, multi-tenant isolation |
| **Input Validation** | 20% | All inputs validated, XSS/SQLi prevention |
| **Secrets Management** | 15% | No hardcoded secrets, proper secret storage |
| **Transport Security** | 10% | HTTPS enforced, secure headers |
| **Error Handling** | 10% | No stack traces exposed, safe error messages |
| **Audit Logging** | 5% | Critical actions logged, PII handling |

### Score Interpretation

- **90-100**: Production-ready, minor improvements only
- **70-89**: Conditional deployment, address high-priority issues first
- **50-69**: Not production-ready, critical gaps exist
- **0-49**: Significant security risks, substantial work needed

### Deployment Decision Matrix

| Score | Blockers | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------|
| ≥ 90 | 0 | **Go** | Production-ready |
| ≥ 70 | 0 | **Conditional** | Deploy with mitigation plan |
| ≥ 70 | ≥ 1 | **No-Go** | Fix blockers first |
| < 70 | Any | **No-Go** | Critical security gaps |

## Hardcoded Secrets Detection

### High-Risk Patterns (Blockers)

```python
# Direct credentials
password = "SuperSecret123"
api_key = "sk-1234567890abcdef"
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://admin:password@localhost"

# Cloud credentials
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY = '{"type": "service_account", ...}'

# Private keys
PRIVATE_KEY = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n..."
JWT_SECRET = "super-secret-jwt-key"

# API tokens
GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_1234567890abcdef"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "sk_live_1234567890"
```

### Detection Commands

```bash
# Search for common secret patterns
grep -r "password\s*=\s*['\"]" . --exclude-dir=node_modules
grep -r "api_key\s*=\s*['\"]" . --exclude-dir=venv
grep -r "sk-[a-zA-Z0-9]{24,}" . --exclude=*.log
grep -r "-----BEGIN.*PRIVATE KEY-----" .

# Environment variable leaks
grep -r "export.*PASSWORD" .
grep -r "os.environ\[.*SECRET" .
```

### False Positives to Ignore

```python
# Placeholder values
API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
PASSWORD = "TODO: set from environment"

# Test/example credentials
test_password = "test123"  # Used in test suite only
EXAMPLE_TOKEN = "sk-1234567890abcdef"  # Documentation example
```

## Compliance Frameworks

### SOC 2 Type II

**Trust Service Principles:**

1. **Security** - Protection against unauthorized access
   - Access controls (authentication, authorization)
   - Encryption (at rest, in transit)
   - Network security (firewalls, VPCs)
   - Monitoring and incident response

2. **Availability** - System accessibility and performance
   - Uptime SLAs (99.9%+)
   - Disaster recovery plans
   - Capacity planning
   - Redundancy and failover

3. **Processing Integrity** - Complete, valid, accurate processing
   - Input validation
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Transaction logging
   - Data integrity checks

4. **Confidentiality** - Restricted information access
   - Data classification
   - Encryption requirements
   - Access logging
   - Secure disposal

5. **Privacy** - Personal information handling
   - Data minimization
   - Consent management
   - Retention policies
   - Data subject rights

### GDPR Compliance

**Key Requirements:**

| Requirement | Implementation | Validation |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **Lawful basis** | User consent, contract, legitimate interest | Documented basis for each data type |
| **Data minimization** | Collect only necessary data | Review all data collection points |
| **Right to access** | Data export endpoint | Test export functionality |
| **Right to erasure** | Data deletion endpoint | Test complete deletion |
| **Right to portability** | Machine-readable export | JSON/CSV export format |
| **Breach notification** | 72-hour notification process | Incident response procedure |
| **Data protection by design** | Privacy considerations in development | Architecture review |

## Threat Modeling (STRIDE)

### STRIDE Framework

| Threat | Description | Example | Mitigation |
|--------|-------------|---------|------------|
| **Spoofing** | Impersonating user/system | Session hijacking | Strong authentication, MFA |
| **Tampering** | Modifying data maliciously | SQL injection | Input validation, parameterized queries |
| **Repudiation** | Denying actions taken | No audit logging | Comprehensive logging, non-repudiation |
| **Information Disclosure** | Exposing sensitive data | Unencrypted transmission | Encryption, access controls |
| **Denial of Service** | Making system unavailable | Resource exhaustion | Rate limiting, resource quotas |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Gaining unauthorized access | Missing authorization checks | Principle of least privilege |

### Threat Modeling Process

1. **Identify Assets** - What needs protection? (user data, credentials, PII)
2. **Create Architecture Overview** - Data flow diagrams, trust boundaries
3. **Identify Threats** - Apply STRIDE to each component
4. **Rate Threats** - Risk = Likelihood × Impact
5. **Mitigate Threats** - Controls, monitoring, incident response
6. **Validate** - Penetration testing, security audits

## Security Testing

### Test Types

| Type | Scope | Frequency | Tools |
|------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **SAST** | Source code analysis | Every PR | Semgrep, Bandit, SonarQube |
| **DAST** | Running application | Weekly | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite |
| **Dependency Scan** | Third-party libraries | Every commit | Dependabot, Snyk |
| **Penetration Test** | Full system | Quarterly | Manual + automated |
| **Compliance Audit** | Controls validation | Annually | External auditor |

2. **Contain** - Isolate affected systems, revoke credentials
3. **Investigate** - Scope, root cause, impact assessment
4. **Remediate** - Fix vulnerability, patch systems
5. **Communicate** - Notify affected parties if required
6. **Learn** - Post-mortem, update procedures, improve detection

## Common Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

### SQL Injection

**Vulnerable:**
```python
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"
cursor.execute(query)
```

**Secure:**
```python
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (username,))
```

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

**Vulnerable:**
```html
<div>{user_input}</div>
```

**Secure:**
```html
<div>{{ user_input | escape }}</div>
```

### Hardcoded Secrets

**Vulnerable:**
```python
API_KEY = "sk-1234567890abcdef"
```

**Secure:**
```python
API_KEY = os.environ["API_KEY"]
```

### Missing Authorization

**Vulnerable:**
```python
@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
def get_user(user_id: int):
    return db.get_user(user_id)  # No auth check!
```

**Secure:**
```python
@app.get("/users/{user_id}")
def get_user(user_id: int, current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    if current_user.id != user_id and not current_user.is_admin:
        raise HTTPException(403, "Forbidden")
    return db.get_user(user_id)
```

## Response Approach

When performing security reviews:

1. **Understand the system** - Architecture, data flows, trust boundaries
2. **Identify critical assets** - What needs protection?
3. **Map attack surface** - Entry points, exposed services
4. **Apply STRIDE** - Threat modeling per component
5. **Test systematically** - SAST, DAST, manual review
6. **Quantify risk** - Calculate deployment readiness score (0-100)
7. **Prioritize issues** - Blockers vs high-priority vs technical debt
8. **Provide remediation** - Specific, actionable recommendations
9. **Identify quick wins** - High-impact, low-effort improvements
10. **Document findings** - Clear report with evidence
