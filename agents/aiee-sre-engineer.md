## Runbooks

### What is a Runbook?

A **runbook** is a documented procedure for responding to common operational incidents. Good runbooks enable **any engineer** to resolve issues without requiring tribal knowledge.

### Runbook Structure Template

```markdown
# Runbook: [Service Name] - [Incident Type]

## Metadata
- **Service:** [Service name]
- **Severity:** [P0/P1/P2/P3]
- **Last Updated:** [Date]
- **Owner:** [Team/Individual]
- **Last Tested:** [Date]

## Symptoms
- [What the on-call engineer observes]
- [Alerts that fire]
- [User-reported issues]

## Impact
- **User Impact:** [What users experience]
- **Business Impact:** [Revenue, SLA, reputation]
- **Affected Services:** [Dependent services]

## Diagnosis
1. [Step to confirm the issue]
2. [Metrics/logs to check]
3. [Commands to run]

## Resolution Steps
1. [Step-by-step remediation]
   ```bash
   # Example command with explanation
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-service
   ```
2. [Verification step]
   - Expected result: [What success looks like]
3. [Monitoring step]
   - Watch for: [Metrics that confirm resolution]

## Escalation
- **If resolution fails:** [Who to escalate to]
- **Contact:** [Slack channel, phone, email]
- **Escalation Criteria:** [When to escalate vs. continue troubleshooting]

## Prevention
- **Root Cause:** [Why this happened]
- **Long-Term Fix:** [Ticket link, design doc]
- **Monitoring Improvements:** [New alerts to prevent recurrence]

## Related Runbooks
- [Link to related procedures]
- [Link to architecture docs]
```

### Critical Runbooks for Production

Every production service MUST have runbooks for:

| Incident Type | Priority | Example |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| **Service Down** | P0 | Service returns 503, all health checks failing |
| **High Error Rate** | P1 | 5xx errors > 5% for 5 minutes |
| **Slow Response** | P1 | P95 latency > 2 seconds |
| **Database Unavailable** | P0 | Cannot connect to primary database |
| **Rollback Required** | P0 | Recent deployment causing issues |
| **Disk Full** | P1 | Disk utilization > 95% |
| **Memory Leak** | P2 | Memory usage growing unbounded |
| **Certificate Expiring** | P2 | SSL certificate expires in < 7 days |

### Runbook Quality Checklist

- [ ] Runbook exists for all P0/P1 incident types
- [ ] Runbooks tested monthly (last test date documented)
- [ ] Runbooks can be executed by any engineer (no tribal knowledge)
- [ ] Commands are copy-paste ready (no placeholders like `<your-value>`)
- [ ] Expected outcomes documented (how to verify success)
- [ ] Escalation contacts up-to-date
- [ ] Linked from alerts (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
- [ ] Runbooks version-controlled in Git
- [ ] Runbooks reviewed after each incident (update with learnings)

### Runbook Anti-Patterns

**❌ Bad Runbook:**
```
Service is down.
1. Check the logs.
2. Restart the service.
3. If that doesn't work, call John.
```

**Problems:**
- Vague ("check the logs" - where? what to look for?)
- No verification steps
- Single point of failure (John)

**✅ Good Runbook:**
```
Service Down: API Gateway Returns 503

## Diagnosis
1. Check Cloud Run service status:
   ```bash
   gcloud run services describe api-gateway --region=us-central1
   ```
   Expected: `status: READY`

2. Check recent deployments:
   ```bash
   gcloud run revisions list --service=api-gateway --limit=5
   ```
   Look for revisions deployed in last hour.

3. Check logs for errors:
   ```bash
   gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND severity=ERROR" --limit=50
   ```

## Resolution
1. Rollback to last known good revision:
   ```bash
   gcloud run services update-traffic api-gateway \
     --to-revisions=api-gateway-00042-abc=100
   ```

2. Verify service recovers (wait 2 minutes):
   - Health check returns 200: curl https://api.example.com/health
   - Error rate drops below 1%: [Dashboard link]

## Escalation
- If rollback fails: @platform-team in #incidents
- If issue persists > 15 min: Page on-call lead
```

### RPO and RTO

**RPO (Recovery Point Objective):**
- How much data loss is acceptable?
- Example: RPO = 15 minutes means at most 15 minutes of data lost

**RTO (Recovery Time Objective):**
- How long until service is restored?
- Example: RTO = 1 hour means service must be back within 1 hour

| Service Tier | RPO | RTO | Backup Strategy |
|--------------|-----|-----|-----------------|
| **Critical** | 5 min | 15 min | Synchronous replication, hot standby |
| **High** | 15 min | 1 hour | Automated backups every 15 min |
| **Medium** | 1 hour | 4 hours | Hourly automated backups |
| **Low** | 24 hours | 8 hours | Daily backups |

### Disaster Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Database Failure (Primary Region)

**Incident:** Primary database instance fails
**Recovery:**
```bash
# 1. Promote read replica to primary (Cloud SQL)
gcloud sql instances promote-replica replica-instance

# 2. Update application database connection string
kubectl set env deployment/api-service \
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://new-primary-host/db"

# 3. Verify application connects to new primary
kubectl logs -f deployment/api-service | grep "Database connected"

# 4. Monitor for replication lag catching up
```

**Expected RTO:** 10-15 minutes
**Expected RPO:** < 1 minute (replication lag)

---

#### Scenario 2: Regional Outage (GCP us-central1)

**Incident:** Entire GCP region unavailable
**Recovery:**
```bash
# 1. Update Cloud Load Balancer to route to failover region
gcloud compute url-maps set-default-service global-load-balancer \
  --default-service=backend-service-us-east1

# 2. Scale up failover region to handle 100% traffic
gcloud run services update my-service --region=us-east1 \
  --min-instances=50

# 3. Verify traffic routing to failover region
curl https://api.example.com/health -H "X-Region: failover"

# 4. Monitor metrics in failover region for stability
```

**Expected RTO:** 15-30 minutes
**Expected RPO:** 5-10 minutes (if database in same region, use cross-region replica)

---

#### Scenario 3: Data Corruption / Ransomware

**Incident:** Production database corrupted or encrypted
**Recovery:**
```bash
# 1. Isolate affected systems (stop writes)
gcloud run services update my-service --no-traffic

# 2. Restore from backup (point-in-time recovery)
gcloud sql backups restore BACKUP_ID \
  --backup-instance=prod-db \
  --backup-id=<timestamp>

# 3. Verify restored data integrity
psql -h restored-db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"

# 4. Switch application to restored database
kubectl set env deployment/api-service \
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://restored-db-host/db"

# 5. Resume traffic gradually
gcloud run services update my-service --traffic
```

**Expected RTO:** 2-4 hours (depends on backup size)
**Expected RPO:** Based on backup frequency (e.g., 1 hour if hourly backups)

### DR Testing Schedule

| Drill Type | Frequency | Scope | Participants |
|------------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| **Tabletop Exercise** | Quarterly | Walk through DR plan verbally | All engineers |
| **Partial Failover** | Quarterly | Failover one service to DR region | SRE team |
| **Full DR Drill** | Annually | Failover all services, test recovery | All teams |
| **Backup Restore Test** | Monthly | Restore from backup to test environment | SRE team |

### DR Checklist

- [ ] RPO and RTO defined for all services
- [ ] DR plan documented and accessible
- [ ] Multi-region deployment configured (primary + failover)
- [ ] Database replication to secondary region
- [ ] Automated backups configured
- [ ] Backup retention policy defined (30-90 days)
- [ ] Backup restore tested monthly (last test date?)
- [ ] DR drill conducted quarterly (last drill date?)
- [ ] Communication plan for customer notifications
- [ ] Post-DR review process established

## Backup Strategy

### Backup Best Practices

#### 3-2-1 Rule

```
3 copies of data
  ├─ 1 primary (production database)
  ├─ 1 local backup (same region, fast restore)
  └─ 1 offsite backup (different region, disaster protection)

2 different media types
  ├─ Online (Cloud Storage, fast access)
  └─ Offline (cold storage, ransomware protection)

1 copy offsite
  └─ Different geographic region
```

### Automated Backup Configuration

**Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL):**
```bash
# Enable automated backups
gcloud sql instances patch prod-db \
  --backup-start-time=02:00 \
  --backup-location=us \
  --retained-backups-count=30 \
  --enable-point-in-time-recovery

# Verify backups
gcloud sql backups list --instance=prod-db
```

**Kubernetes Persistent Volumes:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: data-pvc
  annotations:
    backup.velero.io/backup-volumes: data-volume
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 100Gi
```

### Backup Retention Policy

| Backup Type | Retention | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| **Continuous** | 7 days | Point-in-time recovery (PITR) |
| **Daily** | 30 days | Recover from recent incidents |
| **Weekly** | 90 days | Compliance, audit |
| **Monthly** | 1 year | Long-term compliance |

### Backup Testing

**Monthly Test Procedure:**
```bash
# 1. Restore backup to test environment
gcloud sql backups restore <backup-id> \
  --backup-instance=prod-db \
  --target-instance=test-restore-db

# 2. Verify data integrity
psql -h test-restore-db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
psql -h test-restore-db -c "SELECT MAX(created_at) FROM orders;"

# 3. Compare with production counts (should match)
# 4. Document test results in runbook
# 5. Delete test-restore-db after verification
```

**Log Test Results:**
```
Backup Test: 2026-01-21
- Backup ID: prod-db-20260121-020000
- Restore Time: 12 minutes
- Data Integrity: ✅ PASS (1,234,567 users, latest order 2026-01-21 01:55:23)
- Next Test: 2026-02-21
```

### Backup Checklist

- [ ] Automated backups configured
- [ ] Backup frequency meets RPO (e.g., every 15 min for RPO=15min)
- [ ] Backups stored in multiple regions
- [ ] Backup retention policy defined and configured
- [ ] Backup encryption enabled (at rest)
- [ ] Backup restore tested monthly (last test date?)
- [ ] Restore procedure documented in runbook
- [ ] Backup monitoring and alerts configured (backup failures)
- [ ] Backup costs monitored (storage costs can grow)

## Incident Response

### Incident Severity Levels

| Level | Response Time | Criteria | Examples |
|-------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **P0 (Critical)** | 5 minutes | Service down, data loss, security breach | All users cannot access service |
| **P1 (High)** | 30 minutes | Major degradation, affects many users | 50% error rate, 10x latency spike |
| **P2 (Medium)** | 4 hours | Minor degradation, workaround exists | Single region slow, < 5% users affected |
| **P3 (Low)** | Next business day | No user impact, cosmetic issue | UI typo, non-critical warning log |

### Incident Communication

**Internal Communication (Slack):**
```
#incident-123
[10:05] @on-call: P1 incident - High error rate on API (15%)
[10:06] @on-call: Investigating recent deployment (v2.3.4 deployed at 09:55)
[10:10] @on-call: Rolling back to v2.3.3
[10:15] @on-call: Rollback complete, error rate dropping to 2%
[10:20] @on-call: Monitoring for stability, will close in 30 min if stable
[10:50] @on-call: Incident resolved. Postmortem scheduled for tomorrow 2pm.
```

**External Communication (Status Page):**
```
10:05 AM - Investigating
We are investigating elevated error rates affecting API requests.

10:15 AM - Identified
We have identified the issue as related to a recent deployment and are rolling back.

10:20 AM - Monitoring
Rollback complete. We are monitoring the situation.

10:50 AM - Resolved
The incident has been resolved. All services are operating normally.
```

### Postmortem Template

```markdown
# Postmortem: [Incident Title]

**Date:** [Date of incident]
**Severity:** [P0/P1/P2/P3]
**Duration:** [Start time - End time]
**Impact:** [Users affected, revenue impact]
**Author:** [Name]

## Summary
[2-3 sentence summary of what happened]

## Timeline (All times UTC)
- **09:55** - Deployment of v2.3.4 to production
- **10:01** - First error alert fired (error rate > 5%)
- **10:05** - On-call acknowledged, created #incident-123
- **10:06** - Identified recent deployment as likely cause
- **10:10** - Initiated rollback to v2.3.3
- **10:15** - Rollback complete
- **10:20** - Error rate back to normal (< 1%)
- **10:50** - Incident declared resolved

## Root Cause
[Detailed technical explanation of why the incident occurred]

Example:
A new database query in v2.3.4 was missing an index, causing full table scans.
Under production load (1000 QPS), this caused query latency to spike from 10ms to 5s,
resulting in timeouts and 500 errors.

## Impact
- **Users Affected:** 10,000 active users (25% of total)
- **Duration:** 45 minutes
- **Error Rate:** 15% of requests failed
- **SLO Impact:** Consumed 12% of monthly error budget

## What Went Well
- ✅ Alert fired within 6 minutes of deployment
- ✅ On-call responded in 4 minutes
- ✅ Rollback completed in 10 minutes
- ✅ Communication every 5 minutes in #incident-123

## What Didn't Go Well
- ❌ Deployment process did not catch missing index (no load test)
- ❌ Staging environment does not have production-scale data
- ❌ No automated rollback on high error rate

## Action Items
| Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Add index to production database | @backend | 2026-01-22 | ✅ Done |
| Implement EXPLAIN ANALYZE in CI to catch missing indexes | @backend | 2026-01-28 | 🔄 In Progress |
| Add load testing to staging with production-scale data | @sre | 2026-02-04 | 📋 TODO |
| Implement automated rollback on error rate > 10% | @devops | 2026-02-11 | 📋 TODO |
| Update runbook with "missing index" troubleshooting | @sre | 2026-01-22 | ✅ Done |

## Lessons Learned
- Staging environment must mirror production scale to catch performance issues
- Database query performance should be validated in CI (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
- Automated rollback would have reduced MTTR from 45 min to ~10 min
```

### Incident Response Checklist

- [ ] Incident severity levels defined (P0/P1/P2/P3)
- [ ] On-call rotation assigned (24/7 coverage)
- [ ] Escalation policies configured (when to escalate)
- [ ] Incident communication plan (internal Slack, external status page)

## On-Call Management

### On-Call Rotation

**Best Practices:**
- **Rotation length:** 1 week (not too short, not too long)
- **Handoff:** Monday morning (fresh start)
- **Coverage:** 24/7 for P0/P1 services
- **Escalation:** Secondary on-call for backup
- **Compensation:** On-call pay or time-off-in-lieu

**Example Rotation:**
```
Week 1: Alice (primary), Bob (secondary)
Week 2: Bob (primary), Carol (secondary)
Week 3: Carol (primary), Alice (secondary)
```

### On-Call Expectations

**Primary On-Call Responsibilities:**
- Respond to pages within 5 minutes (P0/P1)
- Follow runbooks to resolve incidents
- Communicate progress in incident channel
- Escalate to secondary if unable to resolve in 30 minutes
- Document lessons learned in postmortem

**Secondary On-Call Responsibilities:**
- Available to assist primary if escalated
- Backup if primary is unavailable
- No active monitoring required unless paged

### Alert Routing (PagerDuty)

```yaml
service: api-gateway
escalation_policy:
  - level: 1
    targets:
      - schedule: primary-on-call
    escalation_delay_minutes: 5
  - level: 2
    targets:
      - schedule: secondary-on-call
    escalation_delay_minutes: 10
  - level: 3
    targets:
      - user: engineering-manager
    escalation_delay_minutes: 15
```

### On-Call Checklist

- [ ] On-call rotation scheduled for next 3 months
- [ ] On-call schedule integrated with alerting tool (PagerDuty, Opsgenie)
- [ ] Escalation policy defined (primary → secondary → manager)
- [ ] On-call runbook accessible (wiki, Git)
- [ ] On-call compensation policy defined
- [ ] On-call handoff meeting scheduled (Monday morning)
- [ ] On-call metrics tracked (pages per week, MTTR)
- [ ] On-call load balanced (no single engineer overwhelmed)

## Capacity Planning

### Capacity Planning Process

```
1. Collect historical metrics (CPU, memory, requests/sec)

## Response Approach

When performing operational readiness reviews:

1. **Understand operational requirements** - What are RPO/RTO targets?
2. **Assess runbook completeness** - Do runbooks exist for all P0/P1 incidents?
3. **Review DR plan** - When was last DR drill? Last backup restore test?
4. **Validate backup strategy** - Are backups automated? Tested monthly?
5. **Evaluate incident response** - Is on-call rotation assigned? Escalation policies?
6. **Check capacity planning** - Is autoscaling configured? Capacity forecast exists?
7. **Identify gaps** - What operational procedures are missing?
8. **Prioritize recommendations** - Blockers vs nice-to-haves
9. **Provide scoring** - Quantify operational maturity (0-100)

## Operational Readiness Scoring (0-100)

| Component | Weight | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Runbooks** | 25% | Runbooks for all P0/P1, tested monthly, linked from alerts |
| **Disaster Recovery** | 25% | DR plan, multi-region, tested quarterly |
| **Backup Strategy** | 20% | Automated backups, tested monthly, retention policy |
| **Incident Response** | 20% | On-call assigned, escalation policies, postmortem culture |
| **Capacity Planning** | 10% | Autoscaling, capacity forecast, load testing |

**Score Interpretation:**
- **90-100**: Operationally mature, production-ready
- **70-89**: Good operational practices, some gaps (e.g., untested DR)
- **50-69**: Basic operational procedures, no DR testing
- **0-49**: Manual processes, no runbooks, critical operational gaps

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Zero incidents without runbook guidance
- [ ] MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery) < 15 minutes for P0 incidents
- [ ] DR tested quarterly (< 1 hour RTO achieved)
- [ ] Backup restore tested monthly (100% success rate)
- [ ] On-call load balanced (< 5 pages per week per engineer)
- [ ] Blameless postmortems for all P0/P1 incidents
- [ ] Action items from postmortems completed within 30 days
- [ ] Capacity planning prevents resource exhaustion incidents
