# Domain-Driven Architecture

Architectural patterns for building maintainable Python applications with clean separation between business logic and infrastructure.

## Core Principle

**"Behavior should drive storage, not the reverse."** Focus on what the system does, not just its data model.

## The Four Pillars

### 1. Domain Model Pattern
The heart of your application - pure business logic, no infrastructure dependencies.

- **Entities**: Objects with long-lived identity (User, Order)
- **Value Objects**: Immutable, defined by attributes (Money, Address)
- **Domain Services**: Logic spanning multiple entities

### 2. Repository Pattern
Abstraction over persistent storage with simple interface.

- Decouple domain from data access
- Enable testing with fake implementations
- Hide persistence complexity

### 3. Service Layer Pattern
Orchestrates use cases and defines application boundaries.

- Thin orchestration, not business logic
- Handles transaction boundaries
- Clear API for use cases

### 4. Unit of Work Pattern
Atomic operations and transaction lifecycle management.

- Explicit transaction boundaries
- Single entry point to repositories
- Ensures consistency

## Aggregate Pattern

Consistency boundaries - clusters of objects that must remain consistent together.

- One aggregate = one repository
- Modify one aggregate per transaction
- Reference others by ID only

## The Dependency Rule

Dependencies point inward:
```
Entrypoints → Service Layer → Domain Model
     ↓              ↓
  Adapters ← ← ← ← ←
```

## When to Apply

| Scenario | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| Complex business rules | Domain Model |
| Multiple data sources | Repository |
| Multiple entry points | Service Layer |
| Transaction management | Unit of Work |
| Complex invariants | Aggregates |

## Multi-Service Architecture

### Service Placement Decision Framework

When deciding where to place new features, domain ownership typically outweighs infrastructure convenience.

**Decision criteria (priority order):**
1. **Domain Ownership** - Which service owns the business capability?
2. **Data Ownership** - Which service owns the authoritative data?
3. **Infrastructure Reuse** - Which service has needed infrastructure already?
4. **Deployment Coupling** - Which choice minimizes cross-service deployments?

**Example:**
| Option | Domain | Data | Infrastructure | Decision |
|--------|--------|------|----------------|----------|
| gateway-service | ❌ (real-time) | ❌ | ✅ (has DB) | Reject |
| migrations-service | ❌ (schemas) | ❌ | ✅ (has batch) | Reject |
| analytics-service | ✅ (analytics) | ✅ (owns data) | ❌ (needs new) | **Accept** |

**Trade-off:** Infrastructure setup is one-time cost; wrong service boundaries compound over time.
